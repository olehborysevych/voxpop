Fuck yeah! Great name for the product. I would love to do this myself but would aso happy to collaborate on this with someone. Otherewise it's just an idea.

Sp, Cheap device with little screen, keyboard, and communication module (wifi, bt? need to clarify a safe communication, Gemini suggests adding tor).
Designed for a sole purpose of sending a single encoded anonymous message to be placed on a public display as a ART project.
Device can be cheap and should cost little. Other artistic perspective could be having a limited number (handreds, thousands) of expensive devices. 
These could exist in parallel as a powerful metaphor.

Hardware:
screen, keyboard, controller with communication module able to login to public network and send encoded message. AA battery. Stores unique password. Can be destroyed after sending a message.

Software:
Cloud function decoding messages with a password, thin layer of censure (human or AI, maybe different wording),  

Gemini estimate:
Components and Estimated Costs:

PCB (Printed Circuit Board):
A simple, single-layer or double-layer PCB would suffice.
Cost: $1-$5 per unit, depending on size and complexity.
For 1000 units: $1,000 - $5,000.
Screen:
A small, monochrome or low-resolution LCD screen.
Cost: $3-$10 per unit.
For 1000 units: $3,000 - $10,000.
Digital Keyboard (Membrane Keypad):
A basic membrane keypad, similar to those found on old mobile phones.
Cost: $1-$3 per unit.
For 1000 units: $1,000 - $3,000.
Communication Module:
This is the most variable cost. Options include:
Wi-Fi module (ESP8266 or similar): $2-$5 per unit.
Cellular module (2G/LTE-M): $5-$15 per unit.
LPWAN module(Lora, or Sigfox): $3-$10 per unit.
For the sake of simplicity and cost, a wifi module is a good choice.
For 1000 units: $2,000 - $5,000.
Microcontroller:
A low-cost microcontroller to handle processing and communication.
Cost: $1-$3 per unit.
For 1000 units: $1,000-$3,000.
Power Source:
Battery and power management circuitry.
Cost: $1-$3 per unit.
For 1000 units: $1,000-$3,000.
Assembly and Testing:
Labor costs for assembling and testing the devices.
Cost: $1-$5 per unit.
For 1000 units: $1,000-$5,000.
Total Estimated Cost:

Based on these estimates, the total cost for a 1000-unit lot could range from $10,000 to $34,000.
This means that the cost per unit would be between $10 and $34.

Estimated Cost Scaling:

While a simple linear scaling of the 1,000-unit cost is not accurate, we can expect significant cost reductions per unit.
Here's a rough estimation:
Instead of $10-$34 per unit, the cost could potentially drop to $7-$25 per unit.
This is a very rough estimate.
Therefore, the total cost for 10,000 units could range from $70,000 to $250,000.


Kickstarter goal could be around 100K for 1000 units.
