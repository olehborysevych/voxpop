A place to collect my thoughts and ideas regarding the Life, the Universe, and Everything.
This is probably going to be political at some point.

What do I know?

I strongly believe I do exist.

As far as I understand there was once so much (neglidgibely little at the same time) of something (energy) and is was so active that it started expanding/changing and forming/revealing  patterns. From simple atoms of matter to crystals, molecules, self replication to life and human culture and technology. I believe that no pattern exists without something that recognizes/interacts with it (why is it true?) in the correct aspect/scale of energy action.
 
Are we still in the same singularity "point"?
