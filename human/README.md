Human identification platform.

Probably a bad name. 
And a really raw and vague idea. 
I feel we might need a way to reliably veryfy we are dealing with a real human.
AI is evolving so fast we must assume that any non-personal communiction might be AI.
Trying to regulate bad actors will only make us more vulnerable. We need to have a "real human" identification,
We could build "human-only" spaces. 
This is a complicated task. Might require some global distributed anonymous identification. Some identification jury duty.
