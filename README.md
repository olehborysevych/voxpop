Capturing some really basic ideas with a potential for implementation

I enjoy literature but I will never be a writer. 
I think and speak in three languages (uk, ru, en). Slowly forgetting bit's of fourth (bg) and learning fifths (de). 
I am bad at expressing my passion in all of them.

I do appresiate fine arts although I had *very bad* in  the "Art" class in 5th grade and it was well deserved. 
Now I understand the teacher was a little *bit* weird but he knew his job.

Music is a huge part of my universe but I do not play any instruments. Don't plan to learn either.
There is no music in my body. My neck hurts after 15 minutes of my *dancing* which is a rythmical head-hsking. 

But I dare to say I know technology and I can solve tasks. 
And I want to create somwething meaningful and beautiful.

Here are ideas I have so far:
// TODO add links here
1. Human-verification platform (link here)
2. AI-driven "forum"
4. Elon's Radio
5. Real Fake News
6. Anonymous single-messenger.
7. AI animation of old photos (+ prompting)
8. 

I also have a separate folder for my thoughts of non-IT nature. Sometimes political staff. I warned you. Here it is.


PS:  Don't expect me to follow strict commercial and industrial software best practices and rules here. I feed family of six following them and making sure others are also follow them 40hrs a week.
PS2: I will probably try to write this as some kind of a techno-post-literature and experiment with this media as a self-expression platform.
